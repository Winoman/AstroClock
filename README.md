# AstroClock
An astrological clock that based on latitude and longitude will compute sunrise and sunset for a given day of the year.  Useful for things like home automation projects where you want to program events like "turn on the outside lights at sunset", etc.  

This project includes a console app to demo usage.  Values in the demo are hard-coded for simplicity.  I can't remember where the original source came from - I think it was a NOAA web site.  The original code was in JavaScript and I ported it to C# for use in various projects I was working on.
